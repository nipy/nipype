Calculates various overlap measures between two maps, using the fuzzy
definition proposed in: Crum et al., Generalized Overlap Measures for
Evaluation and Validation in Medical Image Analysis, IEEE Trans. Med.
Ima. 25(11),pp 1451-1461, Nov. 2006.

in_ref and in_tst are lists of 2/3D images, each element on the list
containing one volume fraction map of a class in a fuzzy partition
of the domain.

Example
~~~~~~~

>>> overlap = FuzzyOverlap()
>>> overlap.inputs.in_ref = [ 'ref_class0.nii', 'ref_class1.nii' ]
>>> overlap.inputs.in_tst = [ 'tst_class0.nii', 'tst_class1.nii' ]

Inputs::

        [Mandatory]
        in_ref: (a list of items which are an existing file name)
                Reference image. Requires the same dimensions as in_tst.

Overlap

Calculates Dice and Jaccard's overlap measures between two ROI maps.
The interface is backwards compatible with the former version in
which only binary files were accepted.

The averaged values of overlap indices can be weighted. Volumes
now can be reported in :math:`mm^3`, although they are given in voxels
to keep backwards compatibility.

Example
~~~~~~~

>>> overlap = Overlap()
>>> overlap.inputs.volume1 = 'cont1.nii'
>>> overlap.inputs.volume2 = 'cont2.nii'
>>> res = overlap.run() # doctest: +SKIP

                interface fails to run
        mask_volume: (an existing file name)
                calculate overlap only within this mask.
        out_file: (a file name, nipype default value: diff.nii)
        weighting: ('none' or 'volume' or 'squared_vol', nipype default
                 value: none)
                'none': no class-overlap weighting is performed. 'volume': computed
                class-overlaps are weighted by class volume 'squared_vol': computed

Calculates similarity between two 3D or 4D volumes. Both volumes have to be in
the same coordinate system, same space within that coordinate system and
with the same voxel dimensions.

.. note:: This interface is an extension of
          :py:class:`nipype.interfaces.nipy.utils.Similarity` to support 4D files.
          Requires :py:mod:`nipy`

Example
~~~~~~~
>>> from nipype.algorithms.metrics import Similarity
>>> similarity = Similarity()
>>> similarity.inputs.volume1 = 'rc1s1.nii'
>>> similarity.inputs.volume2 = 'rc1s2.nii'
>>> similarity.inputs.mask1 = 'mask.nii'
>>> similarity.inputs.mask2 = 'mask.nii'
>>> similarity.inputs.metric = 'cr'
>>> res = similarity.run() # doctest: +SKIP

Inputs::

        [Mandatory]
        volume1: (an existing file name)
                3D/4D volume
        volume2: (an existing file name)
                3D/4D volume

        [Optional]
        ignore_exception: (a boolean, nipype default value: False)
                Print an error message instead of throwing an exception in case the
                interface fails to run
        mask1: (an existing file name)
                3D volume
        mask2: (an existing file name)
                3D volume
        metric: ('cc' or 'cr' or 'crl1' or 'mi' or 'nmi' or 'slr' or a
                 callable value, nipype default value: None)
                str or callable
                Cost-function for assessing image similarity. If a string,
                one of 'cc': correlation coefficient, 'cr': correlation
                ratio, 'crl1': L1-norm based correlation ratio, 'mi': mutual
                information, 'nmi': normalized mutual information, 'slr':
                supervised log-likelihood ratio. If a callable, it should
                take a two-dimensional array representing the image joint
                histogram as an input and return a float.

Outputs::

        similarity: (a list of items which are a float)
