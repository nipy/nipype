                Additional parameters to the command
                flag: %s
        environ: (a dictionary with keys which are a value of type 'str' and
                 with values which are a value of type 'str', nipype default value:
                 {})
                Environment variables
        ignore_exception: (a boolean, nipype default value: False)

                specify image information file. the image info file is generated
                 from original dicom image by diff_unpack program and contains image
                 orientation and other information needed for reconstruction and
                 tracking. by default will look into the image folder for .info file

                 float)
                specify image orientation vectors. if just one argument given,
                 will treat it as filename and read the orientation vectors from

                 numbers and construct the 1st and 2nd vector and calculate the 3rd
                 one automatically.
                 this information will be used to determine image orientation,

                when oblique angle(s) applied, some SIEMENS dti protocols do not

                provide a dicom or nifti image as the reference for the program to
                 figure out the image orientation information. if no such info was
                 found in the given image header, the next 5 options -info, etc.,
                 will be used if provided. if image orientation info can be found
                 in the given reference, all other 5 image orientation options will
                 be IGNORED
                flag: -ref %s
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')

                in some special case, such as heart data, some track may go into

                flag: -rseed %s
        runge_kutta2: (a boolean)
                use 2nd order runge-kutta method for tracking.
                 default tracking method is non-interpolate streamline
                flag: -rk2
        slice_order: (an integer)
                set the slice order. 1 means normal, -1 means reversed. default

                flag: -szx
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')
                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal immediately
                (default), `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
                output, `file` - writes output to file, `none` - output is ignored
        voxel_order: ('RAS' or 'RPS' or 'RAI' or 'RPI' or 'LAI' or 'LAS' or
                 'LPS' or 'LPI')
                specify the voxel order in RL/AP/IS (human brain) reference. must be
                 3 letters with no space in between.
                 for example, RAS means the voxel row is from L->R, the column
                 is from P->A and the slice order is from I->S.
                 by default voxel order is determined by the image orientation
                 (but NOT guaranteed to be correct because of various standards).
                 for example, siemens axial image is LPS, coronal image is LIP and
                 sagittal image is PIL.
                 this information also is NOT needed for tracking but will be saved
                 in the track file and is essential for track display to map onto
                 the right coordinates
                flag: -vorder %s
