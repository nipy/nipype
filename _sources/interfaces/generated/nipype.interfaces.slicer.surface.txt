Wraps command **GrayscaleModelMaker **

title: Grayscale Model Maker

category: Surface Models

description: Create 3D surface models from grayscale data. This module uses Marching Cubes to create an isosurface at a given threshold. The resulting surface consists of triangles that separate a volume into regions below and above the threshold. The resulting surface can be smoothed and decimated. This model works on continuous data while the module Model Maker works on labeled (or discrete) data.

                Target reduction during decimation, as a decimal percentage
                reduction in the number of polygons. If 0, no decimation will be
                done.

                flag: --name %s

                Calculate the point normals? Calculated point normals make the
                surface appear smooth. Without point normals, the surface will
                appear faceted.
                flag: --pointnormals

                Grayscale threshold of isosurface. The resulting surface of
                triangles separates the volume into voxels that lie above (inside)
                and below (outside) the threshold.
                flag: --threshold %f

        [Optional]
        InputVolume: (an existing file name)

        decimate: (a float)
                Chose the target reduction in number of polygons as a decimal
                percentage (between 0 and 1) of the number of polygons. Specifies
                the percentage of triangles to be removed. For example, 0.1 means

                flag: --decimate %f
        end: (an integer)
                If you want to specify a continuous range of labels from which to
                generate models, enter the higher label here. Voxel value up to
                which to continue making models. Skip any values with zero voxels.

        environ: (a dictionary with keys which are a value of type 'str' and
                 with values which are a value of type 'str', nipype default value:

                Environment variables
        filtertype: ('Sinc' or 'Laplacian')
                You can control the type of smoothing done on the models by
                selecting a filter type of either Sinc or Laplacian.
                flag: --filtertype %s
        generateAll: (a boolean)
                Generate models for all labels in the input volume. select this
                option if you want to create all models that correspond to all
                values in a labelmap volume (using the Joint Smoothing option below
                is useful with this option). Ignores Labels, Start Label, End Label
                settings. Skips label 0.

                interface fails to run
        jointsmooth: (a boolean)
                This will ensure that all resulting models fit together smoothly,
                like jigsaw puzzle pieces. Otherwise the models will be smoothed
                independently and may overlap.
                flag: --jointsmooth
        labels: (a list of items which are an integer)
                A comma separated list of label values from which to make models. f
                you specify a list of Labels, it will override any start/end label
                settings. If you click Generate All Models it will override the list
                of labels and any start/end label settings.
                flag: --labels %s
        modelSceneFile: (a boolean or a list of items which are a file name)
                Generated models, under a model hierarchy node. Models are imported
                into Slicer under a model hierarchy node, and their colors are set
                by the color table associated with the input label map volume. The
                model hierarchy node must be created before running the model maker,
                by selecting Create New ModelHierarchy from the Models drop down
                menu. If you're running from the command line, a model hierarchy
                node in a new mrml scene will be created for you.
                flag: --modelSceneFile %s...
        name: (a string)
                Name to use for this model. Any text entered in the entry box will
                be the starting string for the created model file names. The label
                number and the color name will also be part of the file name. If
                making multiple models, use this as a prefix to the label and color
                name.
                flag: --name %s
        pad: (a boolean)
                Pad the input volume with zero value voxels on all 6 faces in order
                to ensure the production of closed surfaces. Sets the origin
                translation and extent translation so that the models still line up
                with the unpadded input volume.
                flag: --pad
        pointnormals: (a boolean)
                Turn this flag on if you wish to calculate the normal vectors for
                the points.
                flag: --pointnormals
        saveIntermediateModels: (a boolean)
                You can save a copy of the models after each of the intermediate
                steps (marching cubes, smoothing, and decimation if not joint
                smoothing, otherwise just after decimation). These intermediate
                models are not saved in the mrml file, you have to load them
                manually after turning off deleting temporary files in they python
                console (View ->Python Interactor) using the following command slice
                r.modules.modelmaker.cliModuleLogic().DeleteTemporaryFilesOff().
                flag: --saveIntermediateModels
        skipUnNamed: (a boolean)
                Select this to not generate models from labels that do not have
                names defined in the color look up table associated with the input
                label map. If true, only models which have an entry in the color
                table will be generated. If false, generate all models that exist
                within the label range.
                flag: --skipUnNamed
        smooth: (an integer)
                Here you can set the number of smoothing iterations for Laplacian
                smoothing, or the degree of the polynomial approximating the
                windowed Sinc function. Use 0 if you wish no smoothing.
                flag: --smooth %d
        splitnormals: (a boolean)
                Splitting normals is useful for visualizing sharp features. However
                it creates holes in surfaces which affects measurements.
                flag: --splitnormals
        start: (an integer)
                If you want to specify a continuous range of labels from which to
                generate models, enter the lower label here. Voxel value from which
                to start making models. Used instead of the label list to specify a
                range (make sure the label list is empty or it will over ride this).
                flag: --start %d
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')
                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal immediately
                (default), `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
                output, `file` - writes output to file, `none` - output is ignored

Outputs::

        modelSceneFile: (a list of items which are an existing file name)
                Generated models, under a model hierarchy node. Models are imported
                into Slicer under a model hierarchy node, and their colors are set
                by the color table associated with the input label map volume. The
                model hierarchy node must be created before running the model maker,
                by selecting Create New ModelHierarchy from the Models drop down
                menu. If you're running from the command line, a model hierarchy
                node in a new mrml scene will be created for you.
