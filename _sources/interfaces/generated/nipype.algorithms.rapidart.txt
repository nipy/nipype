Detects outliers in a functional imaging series

Uses intensity and motion parameters to infer outliers. If `use_norm` is
True, it computes the movement of the center of each face a cuboid centered
around the head and returns the maximal movement across the centers.


Examples
~~~~~~~~

>>> ad = ArtifactDetect()
>>> ad.inputs.realigned_files = 'functional.nii'
>>> ad.inputs.realignment_parameters = 'functional.par'
>>> ad.inputs.parameter_source = 'FSL'
>>> ad.inputs.norm_threshold = 1
>>> ad.inputs.use_differences = [True, False]
>>> ad.inputs.zintensity_threshold = 3
>>> ad.run() # doctest: +SKIP

                brain mask. *file* specifies a brain mask file (should be an image
                file consisting of 0s and 1s). *thresh* specifies a threshold to
                use. By default all voxelsare used, unless one of these mask types
                are defined.

StimulusCorrelation

`Link to code <http://github.com/nipy/nipype/tree/3444b7588a1dea15675dc8a4f5be5f8b753adbd8/nipype/algorithms/rapidart.py#L561>`__

Determines if stimuli are correlated with motion or intensity
parameters.

Currently this class supports an SPM generated design matrix and requires
intensity parameters. This implies that one must run
:ref:`ArtifactDetect <nipype.algorithms.rapidart.ArtifactDetect>`
and :ref:`Level1Design <nipype.interfaces.spm.model.Level1Design>` prior to running this or
provide an SPM.mat file and intensity parameters through some other means.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

>>> sc = StimulusCorrelation()
>>> sc.inputs.realignment_parameters = 'functional.par'
>>> sc.inputs.intensity_values = 'functional.rms'
>>> sc.inputs.spm_mat_file = 'SPM.mat'
>>> sc.inputs.concatenated_design = False
>>> sc.run() # doctest: +SKIP
