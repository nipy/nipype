headline: Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces

description: |
    Nipype, an open-source, community-developed initiative under the umbrella of NiPy, is a Python project that
    provides a uniform interface to existing neuroimaging software and facilitates interaction between these
    packages within a single workflow. Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of
    algorithms from different packages (e.g., SPM, FSL, FreeSurfer, AFNI, Slicer, ANTS), eases the design of
    workflows within and between packages, and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages.
