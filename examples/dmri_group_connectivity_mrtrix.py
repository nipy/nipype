dMRI: Group connectivity - MRtrix, FSL, FreeSurfer
==================================================

Introduction
============

This script, dmri_group_connectivity_mrtrix.py, runs group-based connectivity analysis using
the dmri.mrtrix.connectivity_mapping Nipype workflow. Further detail on the processing can be
found in :doc:`dmri_connectivity_advanced`. This tutorial can be run using:

    python dmri_group_connectivity_mrtrix.py

We perform this analysis using one healthy subject and two subjects who suffer from Parkinson's disease.

The whole package (960 mb as .tar.gz / 1.3 gb uncompressed) including the Freesurfer directories for these subjects, can be acquired from here:

    * http://db.tt/b6F1t0QV

A data package containing the outputs of this pipeline can be obtained from here:

    * http://db.tt/elmMnIt1

Along with MRtrix, FSL, and Freesurfer, you must also have the Connectome File Format
library installed as well as the Connectome Mapper (cmp).

    * MRtrix: http://www.brain.org.au/software/mrtrix/
    * FSL: http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/
    * Freesurfer: http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/
    * CTMK: http://www.cmtk.org/
    * CFF: sudo apt-get install python-cfflib

Or on github at:

    * CFFlib: https://github.com/LTS5/cfflib
    * CMP: https://github.com/LTS5/cmp

Output data can be visualized in ConnectomeViewer, TrackVis, Gephi,
the MRtrix Viewer (mrview), and anything that can view Nifti files.

    * ConnectomeViewer: https://github.com/LTS5/connectomeviewer
    * TrackVis: http://trackvis.org/
    * Gephi: http://gephi.org/

The fiber data is available in Numpy arrays, and the connectivity matrix
is also produced as a MATLAB matrix.



Import the workflows
--------------------
First, we import the necessary modules from nipype.

"""
Define the groups
-----------------
Here we define the groups for this study. We would like to search for differences between the healthy subject and the two
vegetative patients. The group list is defined as a Python dictionary (see http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html),
with group IDs ('controls', 'parkinsons') as keys, and subject/patient names as values. We set the main output directory as 'groupcon'.
"""

group_list = {}
group_list['controls'] = ['cont17']
group_list['parkinsons'] = ['pat10', 'pat20']

"""
The output directory must be named as well.
"""

global output_dir
output_dir = op.abspath('dmri_group_connectivity_mrtrix')

"""
Main processing loop
====================
The title for the final grouped-network connectome file is dependent on the group names. The resulting file for this example
is 'parkinsons-controls.cff'. The following code implements the format a-b-c-...x.cff for an arbitary number of groups.

.. warning::

    The 'info' dictionary below is used to define the input files. In this case, the diffusion weighted image contains the string 'dti'.
    The same applies to the b-values and b-vector files, and this must be changed to fit your naming scheme.

The workflow is created given the information input about the groups and subjects.

.. seealso::

We set values for absolute threshold used on the fractional anisotropy map. This is done
in order to identify single-fiber voxels. In brains with more damage, however, it may be necessary
to reduce the threshold, since their brains are have lower average fractional anisotropy values.

We invert the b-vectors in the encoding file, and set the maximum harmonic order
of the pre-tractography spherical deconvolution step. This is done to show
how to set inputs that will affect both groups.

Next we create and run the second-level pipeline. The purpose of this workflow is simple:
It is used to merge each subject's CFF file into one, so that there is a single file containing
all of the networks for each group. This can be useful for performing Network Brain Statistics
using the NBS plugin in ConnectomeViewer.
