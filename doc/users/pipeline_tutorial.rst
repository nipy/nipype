Requirements
============

  All tutorials

  - Release 0.3 of nipype and it's dependencies have been installed

  Analysis tutorials

  - FSL_, FreeSurfer_ and MATLAB_ are available and callable from the command line

  - SPM_ 5/8 is installed and callable in matlab

  - 4(? XX) GB of space

Checklist for analysis tutorials
================================

For the analysis tutorials, we will be using a slightly modified version of the
FBIRN Phase I travelling data set. 

Step 0
~~~~~~

Download and extract the `Pipeline tutorial data (429MB). 
<http://cirl.berkeley.edu/nipy/nipype-tutorial-0.2.tar.gz>`_  

(checksum: f91b81050e1262f0508d35135c2369f5)


Step 1.
~~~~~~~

Ensure that all programs are available by calling ``bet``, ``matlab``
and then ``which spm`` within matlab to ensure you have spm5/8 in your
matlab path.

Step 2.
~~~~~~~

You can now run the tutorial by typing ``python tutorial_script.py``
within the nipype-tutorial directory. This will run a full first level
analysis on two subjects following by a 1-sample t-test on their first
level results. The next section goes through each section of the
tutorial script and describes what it is doing.
