Install
-------

The installation process is similar to other Python packages.

If you already have a Python environment set up, you can do::

	easy_install nipype

or::

	pip install nipype

Debian and Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the `NeuroDebian <http://neuro.debian.org>`_ repository and install
the ``python-nipype`` package using ``apt-get`` or your favorite package
manager.

Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to get Nipype running on Mac OS X is to install Anaconda_ or
Canopy_ and then add Nipype by executing::

	pip install nipype

Anaconda
~~~~~~~~

Nipype packages for Python 2 and 3; for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux are available
in Anaconda_ through conda-forge. You can install it using::

	conda config --add channels conda-forge
	conda install nipype

From source
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you downloaded the source distribution named something
like ``nipype-x.y.tar.gz``, then unpack the tarball, change into the
``nipype-x.y`` directory and install Nipype using::

    pip install -e .

**Note:** Depending on permissions you may need to use ``sudo``.

Testing the install
-------------------

The best way to test the install is to run the test suite.  If you have
nose_ installed, then do the following::

    python -c "import nipype; nipype.test()"

you can also test with nosetests::

    nosetests --with-doctest <installation filepath>/nipype  --exclude=external --exclude=testing

or::

    nosetests --with-doctest nipype

A successful test run should complete in a few minutes and end with
something like::

    Ran 13053 tests in 126.618s

    OK (SKIP=66)

All tests should pass (unless you're missing a dependency). If SUBJECTS_DIR
variable is not set some FreeSurfer related tests will fail. If any tests
fail, please report them on our `bug tracker
<http://github.com/nipy/nipype/issues>`_.

On Debian systems, set the following environment variable before running
tests::

       export MATLABCMD=$pathtomatlabdir/bin/$platform/MATLAB

where ``$pathtomatlabdir`` is the path to your matlab installation and
``$platform`` is the directory referring to x86 or x64 installations
(typically ``glnxa64`` on 64-bit installations).

Avoiding any MATLAB calls from testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On unix systems, set an empty environment variable::

    export NIPYPE_NO_MATLAB=

This will skip any tests that require matlab.

Recommended Software
------------

Strong Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IPython_ 0.10.2 - 1.0.0
  Interactive python environment. This is necessary for some parallel
  components of the pipeline engine.

Matplotlib_ 1.0 - 1.2
  Plotting library

`RDFLib <http://rdflib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ 4.1
  RDFLibrary required for provenance export as RDF

Sphinx_ 1.1
  Required for building the documentation

`Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_
  Required for building the documentation. The python wrapper package (``graphviz``)
  and the program itself both need to be installed.

Interface Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might not need some of the following packages, depending on what exactly you
want to use nipype for. If you do need any of them, install nipype's wrapper package
(``nipype.interfaces``), then install the programs separately onto your computer, just
like you would install any other app.
