 Download and install
======================

This page covers the necessary steps to install Nipype.

Download
--------

Release 0.10.0: [`zip <https://github.com/nipy/nipype/archive/0.10.0.zip>`__ `tar.gz
<https://github.com/nipy/nipype/archive/0.10.0.tar.gz>`__]

Development: [`zip <http://github.com/nipy/nipype/zipball/master>`__ `tar.gz
<http://github.com/nipy/nipype/tarball/master>`__]

`Prior downloads <http://github.com/nipy/nipype/tags>`_

To check out the latest development version::

        git clone git://github.com/nipy/nipype.git

Install
-------

The installation process is similar to other Python packages.

If you already have a Python environment setup that has the dependencies listed
below, you can do::

	easy_install nipype

or::

	pip install nipype

Debian and Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the `NeuroDebian <http://neuro.debian.org>`_ repository and install
the ``python-nipype`` package using ``apt-get`` or your favorite package
manager.

Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to get nipype running on Mac OS X is to install Anaconda_ or
Canopy_ and then add nibabel and nipype by executing::

	easy_install nibabel
	easy_install nipype

From source
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you downloaded the source distribution named something
like ``nipype-x.y.tar.gz``, then unpack the tarball, change into the
``nipype-x.y`` directory and install nipype using::

    python setup.py install

**Note:** Depending on permissions you may need to use ``sudo``.

Testing the install
-------------------

The best way to test the install is to run the test suite.  If you have
nose_ installed, then do the following::

    python -c "import nipype; nipype.test()"

you can also test with nosetests::

    nosetests --with-doctest /software/nipy-repo/masternipype/nipype
    --exclude=external --exclude=testing

All tests should pass (unless you're missing a dependency). If SUBJECTS_DIR
variable is not set some FreeSurfer related tests will fail. If any tests
fail, please report them on our `bug tracker
<http://github.com/nipy/nipype/issues>`_.

On Debian systems, set the following environment variable before running
tests::

       export MATLABCMD=$pathtomatlabdir/bin/$platform/MATLAB

where, $pathtomatlabdir is the path to your matlab installation and
$platform is the directory referring to x86 or x64 installations
(typically glnxa64 on 64-bit installations).

Avoiding any MATLAB calls from testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On unix systems, set an empty environment variable::

    export NIPYPE_NO_MATLAB=

This will skip any tests that require matlab.

Dependencies
------------

Below is a list of required dependencies, along with additional software
recommendations.

Must Have
