====================
Using Nipype Plugins
====================

The workflow engine supports a plugin architecture for workflow execution. The
available plugins allow local and distributed execution of workflows and
debugging. Each available plugin is described below.

Current plugins are available for Linear, Multiprocessing, IPython_ distributed
processing platforms and for direct processing on SGE_, PBS_, HTCondor_, LSF_, OAR_, and SLURM_. We
anticipate future plugins for the Soma_ workflow.

.. note::

   The current distributed processing plugins rely on the availability of a
   shared filesystem across computational nodes.

   A variety of config options can control how execution behaves in this
   distributed context. These are listed later on in this page.

All plugins can be executed with::

    workflow.run(plugin=PLUGIN_NAME, plugin_args=ARGS_DICT)

Optional arguments::

    status_callback : a function handle
    max_jobs : maximum number of concurrent jobs
    max_tries : number of times to try submitting a job
    retry_timeout : amount of time to wait between tries

.. note::

   Except for the status_callback, the remaining arguments only apply to the
   distributed plugins: MultiProc/IPython(X)/SGE/PBS/HTCondor/HTCondorDAGMan/LSF

For example:


Plugins
=======

Debug
-----

This plugin provides a simple mechanism to debug certain components of a
workflow without executing any node.

Mandatory arguments::

  callable :  A function handle that receives as arguments a node and a graph

The function callable will called for every node from a topological sort of the
execution graph.

Linear
------

This plugin runs the workflow one node at a time in a single process locally.
The order of the nodes is determined by a topological sort of the workflow::

    workflow.run(plugin='Linear')

MultiProc
---------

Uses the Python_ multiprocessing library to distribute jobs as new processes on
a local system.

Optional arguments::

  n_procs :  Number of processes to launch in parallel, if not set number of
  processors/threads will be automatically detected

  memory_gb : Total memory available to be shared by all simultaneous tasks
  currently running, if not set it will be automatically set to 90\% of
  system RAM.

  raise_insufficient : Raise exception when the estimated resources of a node
  exceed the total amount of resources available (memory and threads), when
  ``False`` (default), only a warning will be issued.

  maxtasksperchild : number of nodes to run on each process before refreshing
  the worker (default: 10).


To distribute processing on a multicore machine, simply call::

  workflow.run(plugin='MultiProc')

This will use all available CPUs. If on the other hand you would like to restrict
the number of used resources (to say 2 CPUs), you can call::

  workflow.run(plugin='MultiProc', plugin_args={'n_procs' : 2}

IPython
-------

This plugin provide access to distributed computing using IPython_ parallel
machinery.

.. note::

  We provide backward compatibility with IPython_ versions earlier than
  0.10.1 using the IPythonX plugin. This plugin will be deprecated as of
  version 0.13 of Nipype.

  Please read the IPython_ documentation to determine how to setup your cluster
  for distributed processing. This typically involves calling ipcluster.

Once the clients have been started, any pipeline executed with::

  workflow.run(plugin='IPython')


SGE/PBS
-------

In order to use nipype with SGE_ or PBS_ you simply need to call::

       workflow.run(plugin='SGE')
       workflow.run(plugin='PBS')

Optional arguments::

  template: custom template file to use
  qsub_args: any other command line args to be passed to qsub.
  max_jobname_len: (PBS only) maximum length of the job name.  Default 15.

For example, the following snippet executes the workflow on myqueue with
a custom template::

       workflow.run(plugin='SGE',
          plugin_args=dict(template='mytemplate.sh', qsub_args='-q myqueue')

In addition to overall workflow configuration, you can use node level
configuration for PBS/SGE::

    node.plugin_args = {'qsub_args': '-l nodes=1:ppn=3'}

this would apply only to the node and is useful in situations, where a
particular node might use more resources than other nodes in a workflow.

.. note::

  Setting the keyword `overwrite` would overwrite any global configuration with
  this local configuration::

     node.plugin_args = {'qsub_args': '-l nodes=1:ppn=3', 'overwrite': True}

SGEGraph
~~~~~~~~
SGEGraph_ is an execution plugin working with Sun Grid Engine that allows for
submitting entire graph of dependent jobs at once. This way Nipype does not
need to run a monitoring process - SGE takes care of this. The use of SGEGraph_
is preferred over SGE_ since the latter adds unnecessary load on the submit
machine.

.. note::

  When rerunning unfinished workflows using SGEGraph you may decide not to
  submit jobs for Nodes that previously finished running. This can speed up
  execution, but new or modified inputs that would previously trigger a Node
  to rerun will be ignored. The following option turns on this functionality::

     workflow.run(plugin='SGEGraph', plugin_args = {'dont_resubmit_completed_jobs': True})

LSF
---

Submitting via LSF is almost identical to SGE above above except for the optional arguments field::

    workflow.run(plugin='LSF')

Optional arguments::

  template: custom template file to use
  bsub_args: any other command line args to be passed to bsub.

SLURM
-----

Submitting via SLURM is almost identical to SGE above except for the optional arguments field:

       workflow.run(plugin='SLURM')

Optional arguments::

  template: custom template file to use
  sbatch_args: any other command line args to be passed to bsub.
  jobid_re: regular expression for custom job submission id search


SLURMGraph
~~~~~~~~~~
SLURMGraph_ is an execution plugin working with SLURM that allows for
submitting entire graph of dependent jobs at once. This way Nipype does not
need to run a monitoring process - SLURM takes care of this. The use of SLURMGraph_
plugin is preferred over the vanilla SLURM_ plugin since the latter adds
unnecessary load on the submit machine.


.. note::

  When rerunning unfinished workflows using SLURMGraph you may decide not to
  submit jobs for Nodes that previously finished running. This can speed up
  execution, but new or modified inputs that would previously trigger a Node
  to rerun will be ignored. The following option turns on this functionality::

     workflow.run(plugin='SLURMGraph', plugin_args = {'dont_resubmit_completed_jobs': True})


HTCondor
--------

DAGMan
~~~~~~

With its DAGMan_ component HTCondor_ (previously Condor) allows for submitting
entire graphs of dependent jobs at once (similar to SGEGraph_ and SLURMGraph_).
With the ``CondorDAGMan`` plug-in Nipype can utilize this functionality to
submit complete workflows directly and in a single step.  Consequently, and
in contrast to other plug-ins, workflow execution returns almost
instantaneously -- Nipype is only used to generate the workflow graph,
while job scheduling and dependency resolution are entirely managed by HTCondor_.

Please note that although DAGMan_ supports specification of data dependencies
as well as data provisioning on compute nodes this functionality is currently
not supported by this plug-in. As with all other batch systems supported by
Nipype, only HTCondor pools with a shared file system can be used to process
Nipype workflows.

Workflow execution with HTCondor DAGMan is done by calling::

       workflow.run(plugin='CondorDAGMan')

Job execution behavior can be tweaked with the following optional plug-in
arguments. The value of most arguments can be a literal string or a filename,
where in the latter case the content of the file will be used as the argument
value::

    submit_template : submit spec template for individual jobs in a DAG (see
                 CondorDAGManPlugin.default_submit_template for the default.
    initial_specs : additional submit specs that are prepended to any job's
                 submit file
    override_specs : additional submit specs that are appended to any job's
                 submit file
    wrapper_cmd : path to an exectuable that will be started instead of a node
                 script. This is useful for wrapper script that execute certain
                 functionality prior or after a node runs. If this option is
                 given the wrapper command is called with the respective Python
                 exectuable and the path to the node script as final arguments
    wrapper_args : optional additional arguments to a wrapper command
    dagman_args : arguments to be prepended to the job execution script in the
                  dagman call
    block : if True the plugin call will block until Condor has finished
            prcoessing the entire workflow (default: False)

Please see the `HTCondor documentation`_ for details on possible configuration
options and command line arguments.

Using the ``wrapper_cmd`` argument it is possible to combine Nipype workflow
execution with checkpoint/migration functionality offered by, for example,
DMTCP_. This is especially useful in the case of workflows with long running
nodes, such as Freesurfer's recon-all pipeline, where Condor's job
prioritization algorithm could lead to jobs being evicted from compute
nodes in order to maximize overall troughput. With checkpoint/migration enabled
such a job would be checkpointed prior eviction and resume work from the
checkpointed state after being rescheduled -- instead of restarting from
scratch.

On a Debian system, executing a workflow with support for checkpoint/migration
for all nodes could look like this::

  # define common parameters
  dmtcp_hdr = """
  should_transfer_files = YES
  when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT_OR_EVICT
  kill_sig = 2
  environment = DMTCP_TMPDIR=./;JALIB_STDERR_PATH=/dev/null;DMTCP_PREFIX_ID=$(CLUSTER)_$(PROCESS)
  """
  shim_args = "--log %(basename)s.shimlog --stdout %(basename)s.shimout --stderr %(basename)s.shimerr"
  # run workflow
  workflow.run(
        plugin='CondorDAGMan',
        plugin_args=dict(initial_specs=dmtcp_hdr,
                         wrapper_cmd='/usr/lib/condor/shim_dmtcp',
                         wrapper_args=shim_args)
        )

OAR
---

In order to use nipype with OAR_ you simply need to call::

       workflow.run(plugin='OAR')

Optional arguments::

  template: custom template file to use
  oar_args: any other command line args to be passed to qsub.
  max_jobname_len: (PBS only) maximum length of the job name.  Default 15.

For example, the following snippet executes the workflow on myqueue with
a custom template::

       workflow.run(plugin='oar',
          plugin_args=dict(template='mytemplate.sh', oarsub_args='-q myqueue')

In addition to overall workflow configuration, you can use node level
configuration for OAR::

    node.plugin_args = {'overwrite': True, 'oarsub_args': '-l "nodes=1/cores=3"'}

this would apply only to the node and is useful in situations, where a
particular node might use more resources than other nodes in a workflow.
You need to set the 'overwrite' flag to bypass the general settings-template you defined for the other nodes.


``qsub`` emulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

  This plug-in is deprecated and users should migrate to the more robust and
  more versatile ``CondorDAGMan`` plug-in.

Despite the differences between HTCondor and SGE-like batch systems the plugin
usage (incl. supported arguments) is almost identical. The HTCondor plugin relies
on a ``qsub`` emulation script for HTCondor, called ``condor_qsub`` that can be
obtained from a `Git repository on git.debian.org`_. This script is currently
not shipped with a standard HTCondor distribution, but is included in the HTCondor
package from http://neuro.debian.net. It is sufficient to download this script
and install it in any location on a system that is included in the ``PATH``
configuration.

.. _Git repository on git.debian.org: http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=pkg-exppsy/condor.git;a=blob_plain;f=debian/condor_qsub;hb=HEAD

Running a workflow in a HTCondor pool is done by calling::

       workflow.run(plugin='Condor')

The plugin supports a limited set of qsub arguments (``qsub_args``) that cover
the most common use cases. The ``condor_qsub`` emulation script translates qsub
arguments into the corresponding HTCondor terminology and handles the actual job
submission. For details on supported options see the manpage of ``condor_qsub``.

Optional arguments::

  qsub_args: any other command line args to be passed to condor_qsub.
