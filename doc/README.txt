 Nipype Documentation
======================

This directory contains the documentation for the Nipype_ project.
The documentation is written in reST_ (reStructuredText) and uses
Sphinx_ to render html documentation from the rst source files.

A relatively recent version of Sphinx_ is required to build the
documentation, at least 0.6.x.

Use the ``Makefile`` to build the documentation.  Common commands:

Discover available make targets::

  make help

Clean up previous build::
  
  make clean

Build html documentation::

  make html
