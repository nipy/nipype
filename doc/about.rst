Citation
--------

Each Nipype release is archived on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org>`__, which provides a
:abbr:`DOI (Digital Object Identifier)` for the project and each release, separately.
The project DOI (`10.5281/zenodo.596855 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.596855>`__) will redirect
to the latest release archive, which contains all information needed to cite the release.

If you are a Nipype contributor and your name is not mentioned in the latest release, please submit
a Pull Request modifying the `.zenodo.json
<https://github.com/nipy/nipype/blob/master/.zenodo.json>`__ file.

When publishing results obtained using Nipype we strongly encourage citing the latest Zenodo
archive to give credit to all Nipype contributors.
However, if for some reason the journal you are publishing with does not allow you do cite software
this way you can use the initial paper published in 2011 (see below).
