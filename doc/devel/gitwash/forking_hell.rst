.. _forking:

==========================================
Making your own copy (fork) of nipype
==========================================

You need to do this only once.  The instructions here are very similar
to the instructions at http://help.github.com/forking/ |emdash| please see
that page for more detail.  We're repeating some of it here just to give the
specifics for the nipype_ project, and to suggest some default names.

Set up and configure a github_ account
======================================

If you don't have a github_ account, go to the github_ page, and make one.

You then need to configure your account to allow write access |emdash| see
the ``Generating SSH keys`` help on `github help`_.

Create your own forked copy of nipype_
===========================================

#. Log into your github_ account.
#. Go to the nipype_ github home at `nipype github`_.
#. Click on the *fork* button:

   Now, after a short pause and some 'Hardcore forking action', you
   should find yourself at the home page for your own forked copy of nipype_.
