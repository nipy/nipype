===================
 Sphinx Extensions
===================

We've copied these sphinx extensions over from nipy-core.  Any edits
should be done upstream in nipy-core, not here in nipype!

These a are a few sphinx extensions we are using to build the nipy
documentation.  In this file we list where they each come from, since we intend
to always push back upstream any modifications or improvements we make to them.

* From numpy:
  * numpy_ext

* From ipython
  * ipython_console_highlighting
