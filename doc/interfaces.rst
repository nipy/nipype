Previous versions: `1.5.1 <http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/1.5.1/>`_ `1.5.0 <http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/1.5.0/>`_

Workflows
---------
.. important::

  The workflows that used to live as a module under
  ``nipype.workflows`` have been migrated to the
  new project `NiFlows <https://github.com/niflows>`__.
  These may be installed with the
  `niflow-nipype1-examples <https://pypi.org/project/niflow-nipype1-workflows/>`__
  package, but their continued use is discouraged.
