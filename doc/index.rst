      Current neuroimaging software offer users an incredible opportunity to
      analyze data using a variety of different algorithms. However, this has
      resulted in a heterogeneous collection of specialized applications
      without transparent interoperability or a uniform operating interface.

      *Nipype*, an open-source, community-developed initiative under the
      umbrella of NiPy_, is a Python project that provides a uniform interface
      to existing neuroimaging software and facilitates interaction between
      these packages within a single workflow. Nipype provides an environment
      that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms from different
      packages (e.g., SPM_, FSL_, FreeSurfer_, Camino_, MRtrix_, MNE_, AFNI_, 
      Slicer_), eases the design of workflows within and between packages, and
      reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype is
      creating a collaborative platform for neuroimaging software development 
      in a high-level language and addressing limitations of existing pipeline
      systems.

      *Nipype* allows you to:

      * easily interact with tools from different software packages
      * combine processing steps from different software packages
      * develop new workflows faster by reusing common steps from old ones
      * process data faster by running it in parallel on many cores/machines
      * make your research easily reproducible
      * share your processing workflows with the community
