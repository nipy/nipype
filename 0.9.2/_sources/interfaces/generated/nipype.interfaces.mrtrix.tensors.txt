Wraps command **csdeconv**

Perform non-negativity constrained spherical deconvolution.

Note that this program makes use of implied symmetries in the diffusion profile.
First, the fact the signal attenuation profile is real implies that it has conjugate symmetry,
i.e. Y(l,-m) = Y(l,m)* (where * denotes the complex conjugate). Second, the diffusion profile should be
antipodally symmetric (i.e. S(x) = S(-x)), implying that all odd l components should be zero.
Therefore, this program only computes the even elements.    Note that the spherical harmonics equations used here
differ slightly from those conventionally used, in that the (-1)^m factor has been omitted. This should be taken
into account in all subsequent calculations. Each volume in the output image corresponds to a different spherical
harmonic component, according to the following convention:

* [0] Y(0,0)
* [1] Im {Y(2,2)}
* [2] Im {Y(2,1)}
* [3] Y(2,0)
* [4] Re {Y(2,1)}
* [5] Re {Y(2,2)}
* [6] Im {Y(4,4)}
* [7] Im {Y(4,3)}

Wraps command **dwi2SH**

Convert base diffusion-weighted images to their spherical harmonic representation.

This program outputs the spherical harmonic decomposition for the set measured signal attenuations.
The signal attenuations are calculated by identifying the b-zero images from the diffusion encoding supplied
(i.e. those with zero as the b-value), and dividing the remaining signals by the mean b-zero signal intensity.
The spherical harmonic decomposition is then calculated by least-squares linear fitting.
Note that this program makes use of implied symmetries in the diffusion profile.

First, the fact the signal attenuation profile is real implies that it has conjugate symmetry,
i.e. Y(l,-m) = Y(l,m)* (where * denotes the complex conjugate). Second, the diffusion profile should be
antipodally symmetric (i.e. S(x) = S(-x)), implying that all odd l components should be zero. Therefore,
this program only computes the even elements.

Note that the spherical harmonics equations used here differ slightly from those conventionally used,
in that the (-1)^m factor has been omitted. This should be taken into account in all subsequent calculations.

Each volume in the output image corresponds to a different spherical harmonic component, according to the following convention:

* [0] Y(0,0)
* [1] Im {Y(2,2)}
* [2] Im {Y(2,1)}
* [3] Y(2,0)
* [4] Re {Y(2,1)}
* [5] Re {Y(2,2)}
* [6] Im {Y(4,4)}
* [7] Im {Y(4,3)}

                only peak amplitudes greater than the threshold will be considered
        peaks_image: (an existing file name)
                the program will try to find the peaks that most closely match those

Wraps command **gendir**

generate a set of directions evenly distributed over a hemisphere.

Example
~~~~~~~

>>> import nipype.interfaces.mrtrix as mrt
>>> gendir = mrt.GenerateDirections()
>>> gendir.inputs.num_dirs = 300
>>> gendir.run()                                          # doctest: +SKIP

Inputs::

        [Mandatory]
        num_dirs: (an integer (int or long))
                the number of directions to generate.
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')
                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal
                immediately, `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
                output, `file` - writes output to file, `none` - output is ignored

        [Optional]
        args: (a string)
                Additional parameters to the command
        display_debug: (a boolean)
                Display debugging messages.
        display_info: (a boolean)
                Display information messages.
        environ: (a dictionary with keys which are a value of type 'str' and
                 with values which are a value of type 'str', nipype default value:
                 {})
                Environment variables
        ignore_exception: (a boolean, nipype default value: False)
                Print an error message instead of throwing an exception in case the
                interface fails to run
        niter: (an integer (int or long))
                specify the maximum number of iterations to perform.
        num_dirs: (an integer (int or long))
                the number of directions to generate.
        out_file: (a file name, nipype default value: directions.txt)
                the text file to write the directions to, as [ az el ] pairs.
        power: (a float)
                specify exponent to use for repulsion power law.
        quiet_display: (a boolean)
                do not display information messages or progress status.
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')
                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal
                immediately, `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
                output, `file` - writes output to file, `none` - output is ignored

Outputs::

        out_file: (an existing file name)
                directions file
