Wraps command **hardi_mat**

Use hardi_mat to calculate a reconstruction matrix from a gradient table

Inputs::

        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')
                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal
                immediately, `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
                output, `file` - writes output to file, `none` - output is ignored

        [Optional]
        args: (a string)
                Additional parameters to the command
        bvals: (an existing file name)

                 {})
                Environment variables
        ignore_exception: (a boolean, nipype default value: False)
                Print an error message instead of throwing an exception in case the
                interface fails to run
        image_info: (an existing file name)
                specify image information file. the image info file is generated
                 from original dicom image by diff_unpack program and contains image
                 orientation and other information needed for reconstruction and
                 tracking. by default will look into the image folder for .info file
        image_orientation_vectors: (a list of from 6 to 6 items which are a
                 float)
                specify image orientation vectors. if just one argument given,
                 will treat it as filename and read the orientation vectors from
                 the file. if 6 arguments are given, will treat them as 6 float
                 numbers and construct the 1st and 2nd vector and calculate the 3rd
                 one automatically.
                 this information will be used to determine image orientation,
                 as well as to adjust gradient vectors with oblique angle when
        oblique_correction: (a boolean)
                when oblique angle(s) applied, some SIEMENS dti protocols do not
                 adjust gradient accordingly, thus it requires adjustment for
                correct
                 diffusion tensor calculation

        order: (an integer (int or long))
                maximum order of spherical harmonics. must be even number. default
                 is 4

                provide a dicom or nifti image as the reference for the program to
                 figure out the image orientation information. if no such info was
                 found in the given image header, the next 5 options -info, etc.,
                 will be used if provided. if image orientation info can be found
                 in the given reference, all other 5 image orientation options will
                 be IGNORED
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')
                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal
                immediately, `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
                output, `file` - writes output to file, `none` - output is ignored

                use disc tracking
        dsi: (a boolean)
                 specify the input odf data is dsi. because dsi recon uses fixed
                 pre-calculated matrix, some special orientation patch needs to
                 be applied to keep dti/dsi/q-ball consistent.
        environ: (a dictionary with keys which are a value of type 'str' and

                first mask image
        mask1_threshold: (a float)
                threshold value for the first mask image, if not given, the program

        runge_kutta2: (a boolean)
                use 2nd order runge-kutta method for tracking.
                 default tracking method is non-interpolate streamline
        slice_order: (an integer (int or long))
                set the slice order. 1 means normal, -1 means reversed. default
                value is 1
        step_length: (a float)
                set step length, in the unit of minimum voxel size.
                 default value is 0.1.

                swap x and y vectors while tracking
        swap_yz: (a boolean)

                 'LPS' or 'LPI')
                specify the voxel order in RL/AP/IS (human brain) reference. must be
                 3 letters with no space in between.
                 for example, RAS means the voxel row is from L->R, the column
                 is from P->A and the slice order is from I->S.
                 by default voxel order is determined by the image orientation
                 (but NOT guaranteed to be correct because of various standards).
                 for example, siemens axial image is LPS, coronal image is LIP and
                 sagittal image is PIL.
                 this information also is NOT needed for tracking but will be saved
                 in the track file and is essential for track display to map onto
                 the right coordinates

Outputs::

        track_file: (an existing file name)
                output track file
