* API: SpecifModel no longer supports (concatenate_runs, output_specs). high_pass_filter
       cutoff is mandatory (even if its set to np.inf). Additional interfaces
       SpecifySPMModel and SpecifySparseModel support other types of data.
* API: fsl.DTIFit input "save" is now called "save_tensor"
* API: All inputs of IdentityInterfaces are mandatory by default. You can turn
       this off by specifying mandatory_inputs=False to the constructor.
* API: fsl FILMGLS input "autocorr_estimate" is now called "autocorr_estimate_only"
* API: fsl ContrastMgr now requires access to specific files (no longer accepts
       the result directory)
* API: freesurfer.GLMFit input "surf" is now a boolean with three corresponding
       inputs -- subject_id, hemi, and surf_geo

* ENH: All commandline interfaces display stdout and stderr
* ENH: All interfaces raise exceptions on error with an option to suppress
* ENH: Supports a plugin interface for execution (current support for multiprocessing,
       IPython, SGE, PBS)
* ENH: MapNode runs in parallel under IPython, SGE, MultiProc, PBS
* ENH: Optionally allows keeping only required outputs
* ENH: New interface: utility.Rename to change the name of files, optionally
       using python string-formatting with inputs or regular expressions matching
* ENH: New interface: freesurfer.ApplyMask (mri_mask)
* ENH: New FSL interface -- SwapDimensions (fslswapdim)
* ENH: Sparse models allow regressor scaling and temporal derivatives
* ENH: Added support for the component parts of FSL's TBSS workflow (TBSSSkeleton
       and DistanceMap)
* ENH: dcm2nii interface exposes bvals, bvecs, reoriented and cropped images
* ENH: Added several higher-level interfaces to the fslmaths command:
    - ChangeDataType, Threshold, MeanImage, IsotropicSmooth, ApplyMask, TemporalFilter
      DilateImage, ErodeImage, SpatialFilter, UnaryMaths, BinaryMaths, MultiImageMaths
* ENH: added support for networx 1.4 and improved iterable expansion
* ENH: Replaced BEDPOSTX and EddyCurrent with nipype pipelines
* ENH: Ability to create a hierarchical dot file
* ENH: Improved debugging information for rerunning nodes
* ENH: Added 'stop_on_first_rerun' option
* ENH: Added support for Camino
* ENH: Added support for Camino2Trackvis
* ENH: Added support for Connectome Viewer

* BF: dcm2nii interface handles gzipped files correctly
* BF: FNIRT generates proper outputs
* BF: fsl.DTIFit now properly collects tensor volume
* BF: updatehash now removes old result hash file

Release 0.3.4 (Jan 12, 2011)
============================

* API: hash values for float use a string conversion up to the 10th decimal place.
* API: Iterables in output path will always be generated as _var1_val1_var2_val2 pairs

* ENH: Added support to nipy: GLM fit, contrast estimation and calculating mask from EPI
* ENH: Added support for manipulating surface files in Freesurfer:
    - projecting volume images onto the surface
    - smoothing along the surface
    - transforming a surface image from one subject to another
    - using tksurfer to save pictures of the surface
* ENH: Added support for flash processing using FreeSurfer
* ENH: Added support for flirt matrix in BBRegister
* ENH: Added support for FSL convert_xfm
* ENH: hashes can be updated again without rerunning all nodes.
* ENH: Added multiple regression design for FSL
* ENH: Added SPM based Analyze to Nifti converter
* ENH: Added increased support for PyXNAT
* ENH: Added support for MCR-based binary version of SPM
* ENH: Added SPM node for calculating various threshold statistics
* ENH: Added distance and dissimilarity measurements

* BF: Diffusion toolkit gets installed
* BF: Changed FNIRT interface to accept flexible lists (rather than 4-tuples)
      on all options specific to different subsampling levels

Release 0.3.3 (Sep 16, 2010)
============================

* API: subject_id in ModelSpec is now deprecated
* API: spm.Threshold
  - does not need mask, beta, RPV anymore
  - takes only one image (stat_image - mind the name change)
  - works with SPM2 SPM.mat
  - returns additional map - pre topological FDR

* ENH: Added support for Diffusion toolkit
* ENH: Added support for FSL slicer and overlay
* ENH: Added support for dcm2nii

* BF: DataSink properly handles lists of lists now
* BF: DataGrabber has option for raising Exception on getting empty lists
* BF: Traits logic for 'requires' metadata
* BF: allows workflows to be relocatable
* BF: nested workflows with connections don't raise connection not found error
* BF: multiple workflows with identical nodenames and iterables do not create nestsed workflows
