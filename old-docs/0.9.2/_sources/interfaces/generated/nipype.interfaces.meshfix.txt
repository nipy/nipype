Accepted input formats are OFF, PLY and STL.
Other formats (like .msh for gmsh) are supported only partially.

Example
~~~~~~~

>>> import nipype.interfaces.meshfix as mf
>>> fix = mf.MeshFix()
>>> fix.inputs.in_file1 = 'lh-pial.stl'
>>> fix.inputs.in_file2 = 'rh-pial.stl'
>>> fix.run()                                    # doctest: +SKIP

                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal
                immediately, `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
