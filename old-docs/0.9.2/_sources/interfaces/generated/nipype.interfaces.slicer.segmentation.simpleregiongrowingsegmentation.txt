Wraps command **SimpleRegionGrowingSegmentation **

title: Simple Region Growing Segmentation

category: Segmentation

description: A simple region growing segmentation algorithm based on intensity statistics. To create a list of fiducials (Seeds) for this algorithm, click on the tool bar icon of an arrow pointing to a starburst fiducial to enter the 'place a new object mode' and then use the fiducials module. This module uses the Slicer Command Line Interface (CLI) and the ITK filters CurvatureFlowImageFilter and ConfidenceConnectedImageFilter.

Inputs::

        [Mandatory]
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')
                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal
                immediately, `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
                output, `file` - writes output to file, `none` - output is ignored

        [Optional]
        args: (a string)
                Additional parameters to the command
        environ: (a dictionary with keys which are a value of type 'str' and
                 with values which are a value of type 'str', nipype default value:
                 {})
                Environment variables
        ignore_exception: (a boolean, nipype default value: False)
                Print an error message instead of throwing an exception in case the
                interface fails to run
        inputVolume: (an existing file name)
                Input volume to be filtered
        iterations: (an integer (int or long))
                Number of iterations of region growing
        labelvalue: (an integer (int or long))
                The integer value (0-255) to use for the segmentation results. This
                will determine the color of the segmentation that will be generated
                by the Region growing algorithm
        multiplier: (a float)
                Number of standard deviations to include in intensity model
        neighborhood: (an integer (int or long))
                The radius of the neighborhood over which to calculate intensity
                model
        outputVolume: (a boolean or a file name)
                Output filtered
        seed: (a list of from 3 to 3 items which are a float)
                Seed point(s) for region growing
        smoothingIterations: (an integer (int or long))
                Number of smoothing iterations
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')
                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal
                immediately, `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
                output, `file` - writes output to file, `none` - output is ignored
        timestep: (a float)
                Timestep for curvature flow

Outputs::

        outputVolume: (an existing file name)
                Output filtered
