Wraps command **OtsuThresholdImageFilter **

title: Otsu Threshold Image Filter

category: Legacy.Filtering

description: This filter creates a binary thresholded image that separates an image into foreground and background components. The filter calculates the optimum threshold separating those two classes so that their combined spread (intra-class variance) is minimal (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method).  Then the filter applies that threshold to the input image using the itkBinaryThresholdImageFilter. The numberOfHistogram bins can be set for the Otsu Calculator. The insideValue and outsideValue can be set for the BinaryThresholdImageFilter.  The filter produces a labeled volume.

Inputs::

        [Mandatory]
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')
                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal
                immediately, `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
                output, `file` - writes output to file, `none` - output is ignored

        [Optional]
        args: (a string)
                Additional parameters to the command
        environ: (a dictionary with keys which are a value of type 'str' and
                 with values which are a value of type 'str', nipype default value:
                 {})
                Environment variables
        ignore_exception: (a boolean, nipype default value: False)
                Print an error message instead of throwing an exception in case the
                interface fails to run
        inputVolume: (an existing file name)
                Input volume to be filtered
        insideValue: (an integer (int or long))
                The value assigned to pixels that are inside the computed threshold
        numberOfBins: (an integer (int or long))
                This is an advanced parameter. The number of bins in the histogram
                used to model the probability mass function of the two intensity
                distributions. Small numbers of bins may result in a more
                conservative threshold. The default should suffice for most
                applications. Experimentation is the only way to see the effect of
                varying this parameter.
        outputVolume: (a boolean or a file name)
                Output filtered
        outsideValue: (an integer (int or long))
                The value assigned to pixels that are outside the computed threshold
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')
                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal
                immediately, `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
                output, `file` - writes output to file, `none` - output is ignored

Outputs::

        outputVolume: (an existing file name)

Wraps command **ResampleScalarVolume **

title: Resample Scalar Volume

category: Legacy.Filtering

description: Resampling an image is an important task in image analysis. It is especially important in the frame of image registration. This module implements image resampling through the use of itk Transforms. This module uses an Identity Transform. The resampling is controlled by the Output Spacing. "Resampling" is performed in space coordinates, not pixel/grid coordinates. It is quite important to ensure that image spacing is properly set on the images involved. The interpolator is required since the mapping from one space to the other will often require evaluation of the intensity of the image at non-grid positions. Several interpolators are available: linear, nearest neighbor, bspline and five flavors of sinc. The sinc interpolators, although more precise, are much slower than the linear and nearest neighbor interpolator. To resample label volumnes, nearest neighbor interpolation should be used exclusively.
