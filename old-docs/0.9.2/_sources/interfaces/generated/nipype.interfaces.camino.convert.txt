Wraps command **analyzeheader**

Create or read an Analyze 7.5 header file.

Analyze image header, provides support for the most common header fields.
Some fields, such as patient_id, are not currently supported. The program allows
three nonstandard options: the field image_dimension.funused1 is the image scale.
The intensity of each pixel in the associated .img file is (image value from file) * scale.
Also, the origin of the Talairach coordinates (midline of the anterior commisure) are encoded
in the field data_history.originator. These changes are included for compatibility with SPM.

All headers written with this program are big endian by default.

Example
~~~~~~~

>>> import nipype.interfaces.camino as cmon
>>> hdr = cmon.AnalyzeHeader()
>>> hdr.inputs.in_file = 'tensor_fitted_data.Bdouble'
>>> hdr.inputs.scheme_file = 'A.scheme'
>>> hdr.inputs.data_dims = [256,256,256]
>>> hdr.inputs.voxel_dims = [1,1,1]

Wraps command **niftidt2camino**

Converts NIFTI-1 diffusion tensors to Camino format. The program reads the
NIFTI header but does not apply any spatial transformations to the data. The
NIFTI intensity scaling parameters are applied.

The output is the tensors in Camino voxel ordering: [exit, ln(S0), dxx, dxy,
dxz, dyy, dyz, dzz].

The exit code is set to 0 unless a background mask is supplied, in which case
the code is 0 in brain voxels and -1 in background voxels.

The value of ln(S0) in the output is taken from a file if one is supplied,
otherwise it is set to 0.

NOTE FOR FSL USERS - FSL's dtifit can output NIFTI tensors, but they are not
stored in the usual way (which is using NIFTI_INTENT_SYMMATRIX). FSL's
tensors follow the ITK / VTK "upper-triangular" convention, so you will need
to use the -uppertriangular option to convert these correctly.

Inputs::

        [Mandatory]
        in_file: (an existing file name)
                A NIFTI-1 dataset containing diffusion tensors. The tensors are
                assumed to be in lower-triangular order as specified by the NIFTI
                standard for the storage of symmetric matrices. This file should be
                either a .nii or a .hdr file.
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')
                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal
                immediately, `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display

        [Optional]
        allowmultitargets: (a boolean)
                Allows streamlines to connect to multiple target volumes.
        args: (a string)

                Splits the streamlines at the seed point and computes separate
                connection probabilities for each segment. Streamline segments are
                grouped according to their dot product with the vector (X, Y, Z).
                The ideal vector will be tangential to the streamline trajectory at
                the seed, such that the streamline projects from the seed along (X,
                Y, Z) and -(X, Y, Z). However, it is only necessary for the
                streamline trajectory to not be orthogonal to (X, Y, Z).
        discardloops: (a boolean)
                This option allows streamlines to enter a waypoint exactly once.
                After the streamline leaves the waypoint, the entire streamline is
                discarded upon a second entry to the waypoint.
        endpointfile: (a file name)

                Number of streamlines generated for each seed. Not required when
                outputting streamlines, but needed to create PICo images. The
                default is 1 if the output is streamlines, and 5000 if the output is
                connection probability images.

        noresample: (a boolean)
                Disables resampling of input streamlines. Resampling is
                automatically disabled if the input model is voxels.
        out_file: (a file name)
        outputacm: (a boolean)
                output all tracts in a single connection probability map (Analyze
                image)
        outputcbs: (a boolean)
                outputs connectivity-based segmentation maps; requires target
                outputfile
        outputcp: (a boolean)
                output the connection probability map (Analyze image, float)
        outputroot: (a file name)
                root directory for output
        outputsc: (a boolean)
                output the connection probability map (raw streamlines, int)
        outputtracts: (a boolean)
                Output streamlines in raw binary format.
        regionindex: (an integer (int or long))
                index of specific region to process
        resamplestepsize: (a float)
                Each point on a streamline is tested for entry into target,
                exclusion or waypoint volumes. If the length between points on a
                tract is not much smaller than the voxel length, then streamlines
                may pass through part of a voxel without being counted. To avoid
                this, the program resamples streamlines such that the step size is
                one tenth of the smallest voxel dimension in the image. This
                increases the size of raw or oogl streamline output and incurs some
                performance penalty. The resample resolution can be controlled with
                this option or disabled altogether by passing a negative step size
                or by passing the -noresample option.

                immediately, `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
                output, `file` - writes output to file, `none` - output is ignored
        truncateinexclusion: (a boolean)
                Retain segments of a streamline before entry to an exclusion ROI.
        truncateloops: (a boolean)
                This option allows streamlines to enter a waypoint exactly once.
                After the streamline leaves the waypoint, it is truncated upon a
                second entry to the waypoint.
        voxeldims: (a list of from 3 to 3 items which are an integer (int or

                0 is a waypoint.

Wraps command **tractshredder**

Extracts bunches of streamlines.

tractshredder works in a similar way to shredder, but processes streamlines instead of scalar data.
The input is raw streamlines, in the format produced by track or procstreamlines.

The program first makes an initial offset of offset tracts.  It then reads and outputs a group of
bunchsize tracts, skips space tracts, and repeats until there is no more input.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

>>> import nipype.interfaces.camino as cmon
>>> shred = cmon.TractShredder()
>>> shred.inputs.in_file = 'tract_data.Bfloat'
>>> shred.inputs.offset = 0
>>> shred.inputs.bunchsize = 1
>>> shred.inputs.space = 2
>>> shred.run()                  # doctest: +SKIP
