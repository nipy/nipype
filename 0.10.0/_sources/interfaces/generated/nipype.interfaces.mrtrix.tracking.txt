Wraps command **streamtrack**

Specialized interface to StreamlineTrack. This interface is used for
streamline tracking from diffusion tensor data, and calls the MRtrix
function 'streamtrack' with the option 'DT_STREAM'

Example
~~~~~~~

>>> import nipype.interfaces.mrtrix as mrt
>>> dtstrack = mrt.DiffusionTensorStreamlineTrack()
>>> dtstrack.inputs.in_file = 'data.Bfloat'
>>> dtstrack.inputs.seed_file = 'seed_mask.nii'

Wraps command **streamtrack**

Performs streamline tracking using spherically deconvolved data

Specialized interface to StreamlineTrack. This interface is used for
streamline tracking from spherically deconvolved data, and calls
the MRtrix function 'streamtrack' with the option 'SD_STREAM'
