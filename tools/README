==============
 Nipype Tools
==============

This directory contains various tools used by the nipype developers.
Only install tools here that are unique to the nipype project.  Any
tools shared with our parent project, nipy, should go in the
nipy/tools directory.

Exceptions
----------

* apigen.py: This is not importable from nipy, so I copied it.
* build_modref_templates.py: This was copied and modified to work with nipype.
