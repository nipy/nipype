"""Descriptor support for NIPY.

Utilities to support special Python descriptors [1,2], in particular the use of
a useful pattern for properties we call 'one time properties'.  These are
object attributes which are declared as properties, but become regular
attributes once they've been read the first time.  They can thus be evaluated
later in the object's life cycle, but once evaluated they become normal, static
attributes with no function call overhead on access or any other constraints.
