This directory contains empty, dummy files which are meant to be used
in the doctests of nipype.  For version 0.3 of nipype, we're using
Traits and for input files, the code checks to confirm the assigned
files actually exist.  It doesn't matter what the files are, or even
if they contain "real data", only that they exist.  Again, these files
are only meant to serve as documentation in the doctests.
